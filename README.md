# Testing Practice
This project implements vanilla **Javascript** concepts such as constructor functions and prototypes to build a simple [Book Library App](https://raw.githack.com/johnsonsirv/library-on-firebase/app-logic/index.html) that stores data using an array.

This project was completed in line with standards provided by [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/ "The Global School for Remote Software Developers!").

## Basic Functionalities

1. The ``User`` can add new book to library. The default read/unread status of a new book is ```Unread```

2. The ``User`` can change the ``status`` of a book after they have read it.

3. The ``User`` can remove a book from their library.

**All books are cleared when the page reloads. Only the default book will be persisted in the library.**
