# JESTable Javascript (TDD hands-on)
This project is centered around Jest. It explores some in-built matchers to test some javascript behaviours and to demonstrate some (TDD Concepts)[https://medium.com/@gondy/the-importance-of-test-driven-development-f80b0d02edd8]

This project was completed in line with standards provided by [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/ "The Global School for Remote Software Developers!").

## Basic Tests
Tests cover simple functions such as:

1. ``capitalize(string)`` takes a string and returns that string with the first character capitalized.

2. ``reverseString(string)`` takes a string and returns it reversed.

3. A calculator object that contains the basic operations: add, subtract, divide, and multiply.

4. ``caeser(text)`` (Caeser Cipher)[http://practicalcryptography.com/ciphers/caesar-cipher/]

5. ``arrayAnalysis(arr)`` takes an array of numbers and returns an object with the following properties: ``average``, ``min``, ``max``, and ``length``.
